The final task of this capstone project is to create a presentation based on the outcomes of all tasks in previous modules and labs. 

Your presentation will develop into a story of all your data science journey in this project, and it should be compelling and easy to understand.

In the next exercise, you can find a provided PowerPoint template to help you get started. 
However, you are free to add additional slides, charts, and tables.

There are a total of 40 points possible for the final assessment, and you will be graded by your peers, who are also completing this assignment.
